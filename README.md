# SensitiveEuroPi

EuroPI application that creates CV output from several I2C sensors

## Basic idea

Inspired by Eurorack-Modules interacting with the environment, like e.g. Dieter Doepfer's Theremin (https://doepfer.de/a178.htm) and light controlled voltage source (https://doepfer.de/A1792.htm), I wanted to add some environmental influencce to my modular system.

I recently got a EuroPi module from Allen Synthesis (https://github.com/Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi), which introduces a Raspberry Pi Pico to the modular world. This module seemed to be the perfect starting point to add some sensory to my rack.

Since the EuroPi provides an I2C bus for expansion, I decided to concentrate on I2C capable sensory.

The connection to the sensors is done via an expansion panel. I use TRRS plugs to connect the sensors to the EuroPi module (see ...TODO...).
